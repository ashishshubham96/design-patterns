Creational Design Patterns
  1. Singleton : To restrict client code to create mutiple objects of a class. It can be done using private constructor and a static method, which also needs to be thread safe.
  2. Factory Method DP:
                   ->creating objects of similar type
                   ->Hide complexity of object creation
                   ->Client code has no idea about object creation
